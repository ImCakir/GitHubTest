## Work with Branches, Commits, and Pull Requests

- **Create and manage branches**  
  Understand the importance of using branches to work on isolated features or bug fixes. Practice creating new branches with `git branch` and `git checkout -b`, and switching between them using `git switch` or `git checkout`.

- **Stage and commit changes**  
  Learn how to prepare changes for commit using `git add`, and save them with `git commit -m "message"`. Understand what it means to make an atomic commit, and why writing descriptive commit messages is important for team collaboration.

- **Explore commit history**  
  Use commands like `git log` and `git show` to examine the history of your changes, understand how changes evolve over time, and debug issues more effectively.

- **Merge branches into main**  
  Practice merging feature branches into the main branch using `git merge`. Learn how to resolve merge conflicts when two branches modify the same part of a file.

- **Work with remote repositories**  
  Understand how to push your local changes to a remote GitHub repository with `git push`, and how to fetch and integrate remote changes with `git pull`.

- **Create and review pull requests (PRs)**  
  Open pull requests on GitHub to propose your changes. Learn how to describe what you’ve done, request reviews, and discuss code with collaborators. Practice reviewing others’ PRs as well.

- **Understand basic Git collaboration workflows**  
  Get familiar with common workflows like Feature Branch Workflow or GitHub Flow. Practice collaborating with others by forking, cloning, creating branches, and submitting pull requests.

- **Handle issues and documentation**  
  Understand how to open GitHub issues for bugs or improvements, and how to link commits and PRs to these issues. Also, maintain documentation (like this README) to make the project easy to understand and use.
